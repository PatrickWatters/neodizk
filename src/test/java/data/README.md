# Test data

The file `simple_gadget_r1cs.json` contains the exported JSON R1CS of the `simple_gadget` in Zeth (see: [here](https://github.com/clearmatics/zeth/blob/master/libzeth/tests/circuits/simple_test.cpp)). It is used for testing purposes here, especially to test the loading of arbitrary R1CS programs in an RDD on the cluster here.
